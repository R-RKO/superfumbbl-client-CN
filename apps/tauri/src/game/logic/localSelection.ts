// Owner 10-15 (reported by FUMBBL upstream / Christer): DECLARE ON ACTION, NOT ON CLICK.
//
// Upstream's client sends `clientActingPlayer` only when the coach commits an action. A left-click on an own player in
// SELECT_PLAYER returns InteractionResult.selectAction(...) and sends nothing (ffb-client-logic bb2025
// SelectLogicModule.playerInteraction:46-52); the declaration goes out of performAvailableAction (:100-245, e.g. MOVE
// :127-128, BLOCK :103-104, BLITZ :121-122, HAND_OVER :148-149, PASS :155-156) when an action is picked. Selection is
// client-local; there is no "select" command on the wire.
//
// Order 66 used to declare `move` on the click itself (the left-click auto-Move shortcut), so every Block / Pass /
// Hand-off showed up upstream and in every other client's log as "starts a Move Action" followed by the real action.
// The owner ruled: match upstream exactly. A left-click now SELECTS the player client-side only (the selection ring,
// the reach overlay and the route planner keep working off the client-computed reach); the declaration is sent when
// the coach commits (the first confirmed walk, a block / blitz target, a rail pick).
//
// Pure helpers only: the view owns the selection ref and the renderer; the store owns every send.
